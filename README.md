This repository contains KiCAD drawings for the LED driver PCB design, LED driver box connections, and DIO box connections. It also has the SolidWorks drawings for the panel cutouts in those boxes for CNC machining.

## LED driver
This PCB design is for driving the LED rings at 100FPS with 1A current. Each board will be able to drive 20 IR LEDs in series,
